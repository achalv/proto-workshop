# proto-workshop

This repository contains the source for all the demos built for the IxD and Rapid Prototyping workshop for ACM@UIUC's SIGCHI on 9/23/15.

The idea of this workshop was to introduce participants to jQuery and show them how it can be a useful tool when it comes to quick prototyping with code in the browser. We prototyped a photo gallery which brings up a share modal when you click on a picture. 

#####Contents:
- | [demo](http://achalv.github.io/proto-workshop/demo): This folder contains the basic set up for our prototype, and lets you toggle between the two states of the prototype. Click on a picture to bring up the modal, and click the 'x' to dismiss it.
- | final
  - [fade-in](http://achalv.github.io/proto-workshop/fade-in): Modal state fades in.
  - [bounce-in](http://achalv.github.io/proto-workshop/bounce-in): Modal state bounces in.
  - [pop-up](http://achalv.github.io/proto-workshop/pop-up): Modal has more of a menu-like feel and pops up from the bottom. Click anywhere on the screen to dismiss.
